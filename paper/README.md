# RV565 paper source

This directory contains the measurement-ready academic draft for the RV565
video architecture. Ayushman Bhattacharya is the sole author of the current
draft; contact: `ayushman@pollinations.ai`.

The quantitative fields are intentionally blank. Do not replace them with
estimates. Populate them only from committed benchmark scripts and raw logs
captured on the ESP32-S3 badge.

The prose follows the actual engineering sequence: Python playback exposed
interpreter starvation, native scaling exposed flash I/O, RV565 v4 validated
PSRAM preloading, and the RV565 v6 standalone benchmark demonstrated the DMA
path before reintegration with OreoOS. Figure requirements and provenance are
documented in [`figures/README.md`](figures/README.md).

Engineering work that gates the evaluation is tracked in:

- [#48 — persistent RMT RX failure](https://github.com/elixpo/oreo/issues/48)
- [#49 — component-level firmware/filesystem flashing](https://github.com/elixpo/oreo/issues/49)
- [#50 — native RV565 v6 decompression](https://github.com/elixpo/oreo/issues/50)

Build locally with:

```bash
cd paper
latexmk -pdf rv565.tex

The minimum manual sequence is:

```bash
pdflatex rv565.tex
bibtex rv565
pdflatex rv565.tex
pdflatex rv565.tex
```

Before submission:

1. pin every firmware, ESP-IDF, MicroPython, and ESP-GMF commit;
2. publish the media manifest, licences, and SHA-256 hashes;
3. commit raw serial logs and the script that produces each table;
4. replace every blank rule in the evaluation section;
5. revise the abstract and conclusion with measured results;
6. select a venue template and apply its anonymisation policy; and
7. archive the evaluated repository revision and add its DOI to both the
   paper and `CITATION.cff`.
